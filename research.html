			The goal of this project is to create an educational modality that
			allows anesthesiology trainees to obtain core pain knowledge via a
			learner friendly platform, implementable nationwide at residency
			programs. We will assess whether using an App to transform core
			pain-domain knowledge into smaller elements and solidifying mastery
			of this material using testing with novel gamification techniques
			will improve engagement, learning, and performance.

			We are establishing a clinical research warehouse bank to collect
			and store electronically obtained patient reported outcomes (ePROs)
			using the Collaborative Health Outcomes Information Registry (CHOIR)
			platform from Froedtert Health, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin,
			and MCW patients in a manner conducive to increasing the potential
			for campus-based initiatives to maintain competitiveness with
			similar institutions. The clinical records will be updated regularly
			with new information and changes inserted into the bank (CHOIR Registry).
		</p>
		<p>
			This CHOIR Registry will organize the data from a research perspective
			with plans to utilize this collection and structure for future
			unspecified research projects. The primary benefit of this CHOIR
			Registry is to bring together ePRO clinical data from disparate
			clinical sources (including FH clinics, MCW Clinics, CHW clinics)
			into a single ePRO repository and stored from the research perspective.

			This research will improve understanding of how primary care

			physicians make evidence-based care decisions and improve the lives
			of the millions of Americans who suffer from chronic pain.
