		<p>
			We are establishing a clinical research warehouse bank to collect
			and store electronically obtained patient reported outcomes (ePROs)
			using the Collaborative Health Outcomes Information Registry (CHOIR)
			platform from Froedtert Health, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin,
			and MCW patients in a manner conducive to increasing the potential
			for campus-based initiatives to maintain competitiveness with
			similar institutions. The clinical records will be updated regularly
			with new information and changes inserted into the bank (CHOIR Registry).
		</p>
		<p>
			This CHOIR Registry will organize the data from a research perspective
			with plans to utilize this collection and structure for future
			unspecified research projects. The primary benefit of this CHOIR
			Registry is to bring together ePRO clinical data from disparate
			clinical sources (including FH clinics, MCW Clinics, CHW clinics)
			into a single ePRO repository and stored from the research perspective.

			Identifying opioid response phenotypes in low back pain electronic health data
		</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="section-content">
		<p>
			Low back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide.
			Yet, despite this significant health burden, we lack predictive
			models for clinical care. Unfortunately, clinicians lack clear
			guidance for treatment, specifically regarding the use of opioids.
		</p>
		<p>
			This proposal would accelerate pain medicine research by translating
			clinical experiences into discrete and analyzable data, specifically
			examining opioid response patterns for patients with low back pain
			in the electronic health record. Ultimately, this would provide a
			foundation for advancing clinical care as well as future approaches
			to genomic and personalized medicine.
