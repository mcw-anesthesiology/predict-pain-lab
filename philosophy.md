## Our Mission

To advance our understanding and treatment of pain medicine. To move pain medicine forward, we must adapt how to study and understand pain medicine at the societal and individual level.

Our goal is to understand and study individual narratives of personal pain medicine in order to understand patterns of successful and less successful approaches on a large scale.

Our mission is to forward these goals through innovation, education, and collaboration and we welcome people aligned with our calling to advance pain medicine.

## Expectations of all Lab Members

Above all, we expect everyone to do their very best and to be aware and communicative of what you need to be happy and feel fulfilled. We expect you to work both individually and as part of a team, and open and honest communication is an absolute must. More specifically, we expect scientific integrity, passionate interest, hard work, smart work, common sense, careful execution, maximum efficiency, steady motivation, good scholarship, great vision and most importantly, a positive mental attitude.

Failures, technical problems and mistakes, we certainly expect. But we will not tolerate a negative attitude that harms yourself, the people around you or the morale or reputation of the lab as a whole. We expect you to do what you can to support and encourage your fellow lab members, make sure you have the resources you need to feel supported yourself, and to do your part to keep the atmosphere of the laboratory fun and productive. We expect everyone to attend all lab meetings and participate in the discussion. We expect all lab members to come find us for one on one meetings on a regular basis. Finally, the obvious but mandatory items: we expect all lab members to stick to protocols, lab safety regulations and maintain the highest ethical standards.

### Collaborations

Collaborating can accelerate scientific progress. Although all fellows, graduate students and post-docs should be leading a project, we encourage people to take on collaborations to enrich their experience. From a short-term perspective, they help the project get done more quickly and everyone gets to be on more papers. From a long-term perspective, being led by others helps you to learn how to be a better leader and everyone gets exposure to alternative technical and scientific styles. Ongoing open communication about authorship and contributions is a must, and strong moral fiber in all participants is always expected.

### Competition

Even when a formal collaboration is not appropriate, communicating about progressing projects helps to inform future decisions and prevent redundancy, thereby expediting the discovery of new information and increasing efficiency as a greater scientific community. In environments where trust, openness, honesty and mutual support are held as the highest values, competition can occur in a fun and productive way that is exciting, but not stressful. The degree of competition is an inverted U-shaped curve: without any competition, it is difficult to focus and prioritize; when competition is too intense, quality can be sacrificed for speed; but when there is a healthy balance of friendly competition, then you have peers who can inspire you to raise your standards to the next level and in such cases, competition can also accelerate scientific progress.

### Work Ethic

Our top priority is that people in the lab are happy and stay happy. To be happy, you need to make time to take care of yourself (socialize, exercise, eat healthy, sleep, blow off steam, etc.). To stay happy, you need to maximize your effort/productivity ratio and feel that you are moving forward. We do not necessarily expect people to work evenings and weekends, and we won’t tell you how much vacation you should take. We will ask you to look inside yourself and ask yourself what you are made of and what you want for your future. Excellence and mastery do not come without dedication. Productivity requires both hard work and thoughtful planning and design. That means working smart — considering multiple strategies and selecting the best one. If you must do a risky experiment, do a safe one as well. Hedge your bets. Ask your mentors for advice. Discuss with the lab. Think out loud. Use your colleagues and mentors as resources.

### Technical Issues

First, don’t fix it if it isn’t broken. Second, change one thing at a time. After that, we expect you to ask for help when you need it, but try to figure it out for yourself if you can with manuals or the internet. In terms of equipment and supplies, we expect you to ask to buy equipment that you need to push the field forward and advance the existing realm of possibilities — but do not be wasteful. Try to negotiate a discount or a warranty. If you buy something, make sure we are going to get our money’s worth.

### Personnel funding

We strongly suggest that each and every person who is eligible for personal grants to apply for them: Not only will they benefit the lab, but they will also benefit you and your personal career. Post-docs in particular should expect that applying for and obtaining their own funding will be part of their training. You will be able to attend more conferences and travel the world, you will be able to have more intellectual freedom and you will have a record for being able to fund yourself – all of which will help advance your career and empower you to be an independent investigator.

### Mentorship

Our broader career goal is to make a lasting contribution to the scientific community, and we aim to do so not only with primary research findings, but also by providing exceptional training and mentorship to the next generation of scientists. Each individual discovery is just that: a single discovery that will remain fixed in scientific history. However, each well-trained young investigator is a source of unbounded future contributions. Teaching and mentorship are the lifeblood of our trade, and core values of integrity, rigor, curiosity and inspiration are part of science. Mentorship is a very high priority for us, and it is a great privilege and a great responsibility. We have been fortunate enough to have had several incredible mentors in our careers, and we have them to thank for all of our success. WE have learned a great deal from them, and are excited to be able to pay their good deeds forward. That said, nobody was born perfect, and we are all learning as we go.

### Interpersonal

We’re a family, and we need to take care of each other. Temper your tempers and if you can’t, apologize as soon as you’ve cooled down. If you’re not sure where the boundary is (for space, expectations, demands), please ask.

### Outreach

The more you know, the more you owe. Encouraging younger generations, underprivileged or underrepresented populations, and establishing a culture of paying it forward is central to our lab philosophy.

## Expectations of Fellows and Research Trainees

We expect you to realize your maximum potential. We would not accept you into our lab as a trainee if we did not believe that you had the potential. Bring it!

We expect you to tell us what you need to realize your vision and we will do our best to ensure that you have it. Our goal is to place all of our trainees into career paths where they can make the maximum impact on the scientific community. Our trainees will have ample opportunities to develop the skills that will serve them as a principal investigator, including mentoring, writing grants, giving talks, publishing papers and leading projects to fruition. Most of all, we expect post-docs in our lab to tell us what we can do to be better leaders and mentors.

## Expectations of Learners

We expect you to bring your enthusiasm and curiosity to the lab, along with your questions!  We expect you to speak up about your problems, insecurities, and frustrations so we can help you enjoy all the phases of your graduate training.

We expect you to mentor students, collaborate with each other, learn from post-docs and clinicians about how to find your true calling in pain medicine — what excites you the most?  Remember that we’re all in this together and keep an open mind about what you expect your graduate career to be.  Listen and internalize advice, even if it means you have to repeat your experiment — stubborn students take the longest to graduate.  Roll with the punches and you’ll be a post-doc in no time.  If we design our experiments well, there is something to learn regardless of the outcome.

## Expectations of Staff

Clinical providers and staff, research staff, managers: you are the glue of the lab. You have flexibility and you also need to be flexible. You are to do whatever is needed, and whatever you are best at doing that the lab needs, making sure that we are firing on all cylinders at all times.

This includes protocol work, returning broken equipment, ordering new equipment, helping out on specific projects, and leading projects if you have the desire and ability to do so. The needs of the lab will be constantly evolving as will your responsibilities, opportunities and abilities. We will work together to define your evolving role in the lab depending on your skills, preferences and talents.


## Expectations of Dr. Hurley and Dr. Adams

You can expect us to help you to envision, implement and communicate/publish your stories, and cultivate your career development, whatever your goals may be. You can expect us to make sure that the lab has funding and that you get whatever you need to test your hypothesis.

You can be sure we will work hard to help you prepare for all your personal milestones, be they job talks, qualifying exams, or interviews. You can expect us to nominate you for awards and support your travel to conferences. You can expect us to meet success with celebration and failure with moral support, and always keep it real.

You can count on us to care about your happiness, your project, and your future.
