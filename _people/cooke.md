I am an advanced practicum student working under the supervision of Dr. Rebecca Anderson. I earned my Master's of Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling in 2015 and am currently in my second year of my doctoral program at Marquette University training to be a Counseling Psychologist. I work with patients at the Pain Management Center using biofeedback and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy in order to help reduce and manage pain. Primary research interests are in the areas of mindfulness as well as the process by which therapists conceptualize clients who are racially or ethnically diverse. Personal interests include spending time outdoors with my husband and dog.
