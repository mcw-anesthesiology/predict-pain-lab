Gwynne Kirchen received her medical degree from Ohio State University College of Medicine- where she boldly refused to become a Buckeye. Being a Milwaukee native, she was thrilled to return to the Medical College of Wisconsin to pursue subspecialty training in anesthesiology and then pain medicine. During these years she explored leadership and administrative roles as chief resident and was recognized with an award for Outstanding Clinical Anesthesiology Resident. When not at work, Gwynne enjoys spending time with her high-school sweetheart turned husband, toddler and two ferocious Chihuahuas.
