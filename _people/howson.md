Christopher Howson pursued an undergraduate education at the University of Notre Dame with a focus on biology, business, and of course football (he remains a fanatic fan, GO IRISH!!).  He then received his medical degree from The Ohio State University College of Medicine and subsequently trained at the University of Pittsburgh for his anesthesiology residency where he had the privilege of being chief resident during his final year of training.  He came to Medical College of Wisconsin to further his training in both the art and science of pain management.  Chris currently resides in Wauwatosa with his beautiful wife, two year old son, and Australian Shepherd.
