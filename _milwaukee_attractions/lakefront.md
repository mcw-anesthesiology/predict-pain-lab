The popular six-mile Lakefront Trail runs along the shoreline, beginning just north of The Milwaukee Art Museum. Veterans Park includes a paved, three-mile loop and a 20-station exercise course. The one-mile, Lakeshore State Park (“Summerfest Island”) Loop is the perfect place to check out the city’s warm weather festival scene. If you’re looking for a more relaxing day, take a stroll along the lakefront and enjoy the scenery of lake Michigan.
