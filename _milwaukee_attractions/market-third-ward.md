The Third Ward offers the city's most dynamic array of restaurants, spas, theaters, galleries, and boutiques all in a historic warehouse setting. Central to the Third Ward, the Milwaukee Public Market offers high-quality artisan foods through over 15 different merchants ranging from cheese and wine specialties to authentic ethnic food. Vendors offer the freshest varieties of cuisine in downtown Milwaukee. We love coming for the fun, busy atmosphere and the down-to-earth distinction that the market has above any other typical grocery store.
