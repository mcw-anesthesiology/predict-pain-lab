If you’re looking for a relaxing beach day, head to Atwater park/beach. The beach is actually hidden and you will have to go down a long set of stairs to reach the sand and water at the bottom (but it’s so worth it once you reach the beach!). Here you’ll find the Juame Plansa Statue at the top on the park as well as one of the most beautiful views of Lake Michigan.
