Miller Park is home to the Milwaukee Brewers and features the only fan shaped roof in North America that can open or close in 10 minutes. Enjoy tailgating on the Miller Park grounds before a Brewer’s game or if baseball isn’t your thing, the park is known to host some memorable concerts you can attend.
