The art museum is iconic to Milwaukee’s lakefront not only because of its unique design but more so for its activities and exhibits. Be sure to head over to the museum every first Thursday of the month (admission is free then!) and don’t forget to [check out the “Milwaukee After Dark” parties][after-dark] they throw once a month. On any given day you can sit inside the calatrava (main atrium) and enjoy the art museum café as well as a spectacular view of the lake.
